FED Responsive Boilerplate
===============

Front End Developer boilerplate. Loosly based off of [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) with Delphic customization.

## Features

* [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css).
* [onMediaQuery](https://github.com/JoshBarr/on-media-query) for responsive development.
* [LABjs (Loading And Blocking JavaScript)](https://github.com/getify/LABjs) performance script loader with [custom Delphic wrapper and config](https://github.com/delphic-digital/delphic-jsload).

## Description of files

### JavaScript

* __js/main.js__ Contains all the site JavaScript application code. ALL JavaScript application code should go into this one file for performance and maintainability. See documentation on this file _(coming soon)_.

* __js/lib/delphic.jsload.js__ Wrapper function for LABjs. This is included by default because page specific JavaScripts should be loaded on demand.

* __js/plugins/*__ Put any JavaScript plugins in here to be used asynchronously and on demand with the dd-jsloader.

### CSS / SCSS

* __css/__ This is where SCSS files that have been compiled into CSS will live as well as plugin CSS files (see comment below).

* __css/plugins/*__ Put any css file in here that correspond to the js/plugins you have added to the site. These css files can be loaded on demand. See the main.js documention _(coming soon)_.

#### SCSS / SASS Guidelines

When architecting the SCSS/Sass for a project, we look to a quote by Tolkien by way of [Hugo Giraudel](http://sass-guidelin.es/):

> "One file to rule them all,
> One file to find them,
> One file to bring them all,
> And in the Sass way merge them."
> â€” J.R.R. Tolkien

The main.scss file is the hub for all of your partial stylesheets (which are denoted by the underscore in their filenames).

As with all Delphic projects, we follow the [mobile first](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/responsivedesign/) mantra.

## How to use it


### Building
When your site is ready for production, you can run some grunt commands.

A standard build will:

* Minify main.css
* Combine and minify onmediaquery.js, LAB.js,delphic.jsload.js and main.js into one file.  
* Files are created in the same directory and named *.min.css or *.min.js

```
grunt dev
```

```
grunt prod
```
