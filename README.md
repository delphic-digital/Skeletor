## Introduction

_Skeletor_ is a directory structure and Gruntfile designed as an easy starting point for front end development of projects. Mainly it was developed for projects at Delphic Digital, but it was designed to be agnostic, so any project is capable of using it. It is designed to give you a quick and organized way to start developing web apps with best practices in mind.

### Preface
We gathered our best practices and what works best for our type of projects into a bunch of code to kick off projects.

### Get started

See the [docs](doc/TOC.md).


#### Disclaimer
This repository gets updated as more best practices or discoveries are implemented.
