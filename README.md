#### SCSS / SASS Guidelines

When architecting the SCSS/Sass for a project, we look to a quote by Tolkien by way of [Hugo Giraudel](http://sass-guidelin.es/):

> "One file to rule them all,
> One file to find them,
> One file to bring them all,
> And in the Sass way merge them."
> â€” J.R.R. Tolkien

The main.scss file is the hub for all of your styles. Main merges all of your partial stylesheets (which are denoted by the underscore in their filenames) into your final single __css/main.css__ file.

As with all Delphic projects, we follow the [mobile first](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/responsivedesign/) mantra. We now apply this methodology to pages or components per file in our partials folder.
