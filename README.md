# Front End build boilerplate 

 - `npm install`
 - `npm start` runs a build, starts the watchers, fires up browsersync
 - `npm run build` runs a build
 - `npm test` runs the tests - not that there are any yet

💀 - Will need configured for each project.

 - TODO: Browsersync serving local files (for prototyping before the main site is ready to proxy)
 - TODO: Browsersync streaming
 - TODO: configure linting to standards we all agree on
 - TODO: Testing examples (ava)
 - TODO: SVG png sprite fallback?
 - TODO: check sass linting is actually working
 - TODO: postcss, autoprefixer & css next

## General

 - 💀 local proxy (./gulpfile.js `global.skeletor.proxy`)
 - 💀 FED src files directory (./gulpfile.js `const fedSrcRoot = ...`)
 - 💀 JS distribution directory (./gulpfile.js `global.skeletor.distJsDir`)
 - 💀 CSS distribution directory (./gulpfile.js `global.skeletor.distCssDir`)
 - 💀 SVG distribution directory (./gulpfile.js `global.skeletor.distSpriteSvgDir`)
 - 💀 png distribution directory (./gulpfile.js `global.skeletor.distSpritePngDir`)
 - 💀 CSS sprite sheet directory url (./gulpfile.js `global.skeletor.distCssPngSpriteDirUrl`) 

## JS

include ./dist/js/commons.js on every page.

For special js heavy pages, `import` their components into ./src/js/special-page.js and include ./dist/js/special-page.js on the site

 - ES6: write modern modular Javascript!
 - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): code styles defined in the .eslintrc.js file
 - Bundle analysis (after you `npm start` open [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888/))
 - 💀 [Code splitting](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/commons-chunk-plugin/), modules defined in >3 chunks will be split out into their own chunk. 

## SASS

 - Susy
 - Breakpoints
 - Bourbon
 - [Sass-lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint)

## SVG

Place individual svg files in ./src/sprite_svg/

 - 💀 Compiles svgs into a sprite file ready to be `<use>`d
 - Generates _svg.scss which provides the `inline-svg` mixin for setting svgs as css backgrounds

## Png Sprites

Place individual png files in ./src/sprite_png/

 - 💀 Sprites the png files into pngSprite.png
 - Generates _png.scss which provieds the `sprites` mixin and utility classes to set pngs as css backgrounds (I think - need to verify)

## Editor plugins

For VS Code:

 - [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) will underline code formatting issues so you can catch them without relying on the command line output.
 - [Style Lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shinnn.stylelint) same for Sass.
 - [Import Cost](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost) Will the size of the js you import and warn when it's getting too big.


## Introduction

_Skeletor_ is a directory structure and Gulpfile designed as an easy starting point for front end development of projects. Mainly it was developed for projects at Delphic Digital, but it was designed to be agnostic, so any project is capable of using it. It is designed to give you a quick and organized way to start developing websites with best practices in mind.

### Preface
We gathered our best practices and what works best for our type of projects into a bunch of code to kick off projects.

### Get started

See [The Fednet](https://fednet.herokuapp.com/skeletor/introduction).


#### Disclaimer
This project gets updated as more best practices or discoveries are implemented.
