## Extensible front-end framework.

Skeletor is a powerful framework designed as a starting point for front end development of projects. It was designed to give you a quick and organized way to start developing web sites with best practices and patterns in mind. It makes use of the latest and greatest web technology and performance.

Skeletor tries to achieve a very minimalistic design to remain as flexible as possible. Everything included is very basic skeleton code to give you a headstart. There isn't much templated code, but there are the tools and patterns in place to quickly prototype anything. This framework is meant for intermediate to advanced front end developers.
